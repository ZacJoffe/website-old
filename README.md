# Website
A personal website made with Vue.js and Vuetify, featuring a simple mobile-friendly material interface.

## Netlify
This website is hosted with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify is a great choice as it allows you to easily host web apps using their continuous deployment pipeline. As I used the Vue CLI for this project, I followed [this](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#netlify) documentation to get set up.

Since it takes the latest code from master, all active development will occur in other branches.

## Material Design
This is the first time I've used Vuetify for a personal project. I decided to use it as it gives you lots of tools to create a beautiful looking material layout without tinkering with CSS. It's a great API and has worked perfectly for this project.

## Future of the Project
I'd love to continue adding to and improving the site over time. As I work on more projects, I will add to the `projects` page and update any other information as necessary. My resume is pulled straight from the master branch of my [repository](https://github.com/ZacJoffe/latex-resume), and as such will be updated automatically.
